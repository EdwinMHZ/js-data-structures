/*
    A method for solving complex problem by
    breaking it down into a collection of simpler
    subproblems, solving each of those subproblems
    just once and storing their solution.

    IT ONLY WORKS ON PROBLEMS WITH:
    -OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE: A problem is to have optimal
    substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed
    from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
    -OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS: A problem is said to have
    overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down
    into subproblems which are reused several times.
    Example: Fibonnaci Sequence
