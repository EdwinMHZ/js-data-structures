/* UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the importance pieces of data that are a part of the problem? */

// Example: Write a function which takes two numbers and return their sum

/* 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words? Implement addition
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem? Two integer numbers
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? An integer, the result of the addition
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?. Yes */
