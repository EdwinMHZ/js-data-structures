// Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

// Example
//Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string

function charCount(str) {
  //Do something
  // Return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string
}

function charCount(str) {
  //make object to return at end
  //loop over string, for each character...
  //if the char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
  //if the char is a number/letter AND is not in object, add it to object and set value to 1
  //if character is something else don't do anything
  // Return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string
}
